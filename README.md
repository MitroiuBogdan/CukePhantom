# GlassGate

**GlassGate** is a Spring Boot-based proxy application that retrieves and serves external webpages through a RESTful endpoint. Designed as a lightweight and secure bridge between clients and external sites, it acts as a reflective gateway — efficiently mirroring external content while offering potential for inspection, transformation, or monitoring.

---

## 🔍 Features

- 🌐 **Proxy Endpoint**  
  Retrieves and returns full HTML content from specified external URLs.

- 🧩 **Modular Design**  
  Clean separation between core proxy logic and testing components.

- ⚙️ **Spring Boot Powered**  
  Fast startup, easy configuration, production-ready out of the box.

## 🧪 PhantomBridge (Testing Module)

**PhantomBridge** is the dedicated testing module for GlassGate. It leverages the combined power of **Cucumber** for behavior-driven test scenarios and **Playwright** for full-browser automation, ensuring that the proxied webpages are not only delivered correctly, but rendered and functioning as expected on the client side.

### Key Capabilities:

- ✅ BDD Scenarios with **Cucumber**  
  Write human-readable tests that define expected behaviors of the proxy and target webpages.

- 🕵️‍♂️ Full browser automation with **Playwright**  
  Simulates real-world rendering and user interaction to validate the integrity of retrieved pages.

- 🔗 **End-to-End Verification**  
  The proxy and testing module are tightly integrated, with tests verifying actual HTML output and rendering post-proxy.

- 👻 Phantom-level precision  
  Executes in the background, inspecting structure, content, and visual correctness silently and effectively.

## 🚀 Use Cases

- Safely exposing or monitoring external content
- Building custom content wrappers or analyzers
- Validating webpage availability and content accuracy after proxying
- Ensuring consistent rendering and client-side behavior of proxied pages
